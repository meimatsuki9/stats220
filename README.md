# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in bachelor of science, majoring in computer science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I have heard past students say that this paper will help me with my major.
- I am interested in learning about different kind of coding.
