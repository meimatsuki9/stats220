## Bus trips to campus
- This dynamic report tracks and analyzes the dataset `Bus trips to campus`. The analysis looks at how long the bus took to arrive after the scheduled time, whether it was a double decker bus, and how long the bus ride was.It also includes summary statistics like minimum, maximum, and mean values, as well as graphical representations through bar charts.

## The summary values of how late the bus was:
